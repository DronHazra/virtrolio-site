# Virtrolio
Virtrolio is a webservice that lets you send messages to a friend or colleague's virtual book. It was originally created due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing schools and preventing students from signing each other's yearbooks. Link to the website: https://virtrolio.web.app/

## How We Built It
Virtrolio is built using Angular and Bootstrap in the frontend, with Firebase for data storage, hosting, and user authentication. Firebase was chosen for it's ease of use and integration with various login systems. By using well-tested login systems we remove the need to worry about login security.

## Our Goal
The goal of virtrolio is to allow users to write memorable messages to one another. We hope to give everyone the chance to do this, even if they cannot physically send anything.
