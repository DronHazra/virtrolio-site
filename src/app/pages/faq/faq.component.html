          Ask them for their 'sharing link' (which they can get from their 'Your Virtrolio' page). Then visit that
          sharing link and sign in if you haven't already. You will then be taken to a wonderful place with many
          formatting tools to type your customized message.

          As per our <a routerLink="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, you cannot delete a message once you have sent
          it. This is to more closely emulate real-life yearbook signing, in that the virtrolio (and all its messages)
          will stay with the <em>receiver</em>. In order to have your message deleted, you
          must ask the <em>recipient</em> of your message to delete it.

          Yes and no. For any one version of the website (for example, if you just created an account with us), then you
          will only be able to send one message to each of your friends. You probably wouldn't
          sign someone's yearbook more than once in real life
          (unless
          you just <em>wanted</em> to take space away from others). As such, we decided that you can send one very
          special, meaningful message. However, if we make a major update to the website,
          then we will allow for <strong>one extra message to be sent to each of your friends</strong> so that you can
          try out the new update's features.

          <p>Yes, if you have the images uploaded to some other website (since we do not store images on virtrolio).
            We're working on adding a menu to allow you to do this soon!</p>

          <p>However, if you know a bit of HTML, you can do it yourself like this: <strong
            style="font-family: Consolas, sans-serif">&lt;img src="insert link URL"&gt;</strong> and you will be able to
            see it in the preview panel while you sign your message if you do it properly with a URL that works.</p>

          <p><strong>Note: Not every URL works, and some URLs will only work temporarily, which makes things difficult
            when you want the messages to last for a long time.</strong> If the URL holding your image stops working,
            then so will your image, even if you already sent it. The only way a recipient could keep the image if it
            was on a temporary link is if they printed out their virtrolio or downloaded a type of file that would allow
            them to view the image (features which we have not implemented yet). As such, we recommend that you link to
            images which you know will work not only now but also in the future when your friend reads your message.
            From what has been tested, Google Photos links can expire after a day. Other image sharing / storing
            services such as Google Drive and Imgur are possible alternatives. Virtrolio is not making any suggestions
            for software to use in this regard; we are simply making you aware of the options that are out there.</p>

          <p>Even if the URL you use does lead to an image, the URL must contain ONLY an image for it to work in
            your virtrolio message. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2NRCMvu">this link</a> will not
            work but <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BuNxkA">this one</a> will. Usually, a 'usable' URL in this
            context will have an 'image file extension' at the end of the URL—something like .jpg or .png or .gif. Some
            people call this type of link an 'embed link', as these links can be used to 'embed' content into a website.
            To find this link, you could search up how to get the 'embed link' for whatever online service you used to
            upload and store your photos. For some websites, it is much easier to get this embed link—the website might
            even provide an easy-to-use button. For other websites, you might need to right-click on an image and try to
            click 'Open image in new tab' until you get a link which looks like a valid 'embed link' with only the image
            on it. </p>

          <p>On a related note, if you know some more HTML / CSS then you can style your images too (for example,
            <strong style="font-family: Consolas, sans-serif">&lt;img src="URL" width = 100%&gt;</strong> is very useful
            for scaling your images to a proper, viewable size). We are working on a more user-friendly menu to be able
            to insert images into your message if you're not comfortable with this, so watch out for that!</p>

          After sending your messages, you do not own them anymore, so you cannot download or save them then. If you
          want to download and save the messages you have <em>received</em>, we currently have the option for you to
          download all
          your data as a .json file (go to your settings page for this option). We are working on a way for you to be
          able download your messages in a more user-friendly format, though, so stay tuned!

          Go to <a routerLink="/your-virtrolio">your Virtrolio</a> and click on 'Sharing Link', then generate a new
          link from there. Be aware—doing so will invalidate all previous links!

          You can generate a new sharing link if people are sending you messages you do not approve of using your old
          one. This helps prevent spammers and bullies from clogging up your virtrolio.
          Only people with your <em>newest</em> sharing link can sign your virtrolio.
