                Weâ€™re a group of undergraduate university students who remember exactly what it was like back in high school, and we especially remember what those last few months of senior year meant to many of us. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to lockdowns and social distancing, we wanted to give a way for graduating students (and others!) to be able to send each other messages in a medium that they can cherish with them as they continue on in their journeys.
