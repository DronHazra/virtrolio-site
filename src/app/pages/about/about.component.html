                Weâ€™re a group of undergraduate university students who remember exactly what it was like back in high school, and we especially remember what those last few months of senior year meant to many of us. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to lockdowns and social distancing, we wanted to give a way for graduating students (and others!) to be able to send each other messages in a medium that they can cherish with them as they continue on in their journeys.

While a true technical and computer wizard at the keyboard, Janakitti is also the <strong>sac</strong> that holds the team together. Janakitti is currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

                    John is the fearless, heroic and noble creator of all the static pages you see on the Virtrolio site. In his domain, all browsers are welcome (with the exception of IE11) and are served with the very best static pages. John is currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and is a huge fan of video games made by Naughty Dog. At the time of writing this, Naughty Dog's latest video game <i>The Last of Us Part II</i> will be released this coming friday, and John is extremely excited to experience the post-apocalyptic world of TLOU2 and to be moved by its characters and story. John will most likely skip the upcoming Virtrolio meeting to play it.
