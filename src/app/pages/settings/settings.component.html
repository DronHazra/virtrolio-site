            Clicking the button below will allow you to download all data associated with you that is stored
            on Virtrolio. This data includes your user data and messages that you have received.
            Note that this does not include messages written <b>by</b> you, as those messages are owned
            by the message recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data will be provided in one of several file formats including .zip, .json, .csv, .txt or .xlsx.
            You may need additional software to open some of these file types.
            <u>Virtrolio will not make any recommendations on what software to use.</u>
